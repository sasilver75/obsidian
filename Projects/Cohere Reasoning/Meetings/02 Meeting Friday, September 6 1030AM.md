Before end of year break, if we can get ton Arxiv-worthy paper by then, we can work backwards from there.

The math and code stuff is most important
But perturbing some if the IF Eval things are going to be harder. We should start with one or two datasets.

We should do the obvious thing first and see if we can complete the paper just with that and then consider other things.


Leetcode-like datasets... unsure if MBPP/HumanEval


For the ones that get 10/10 correct under T=.2 (or whatever), see if even the ones 
Look at the ones in the middle, which are the ones that  the model is sort of unsure of (but still capable of solving)
Also look at the ones on the rightmost (h/t Jimin)
