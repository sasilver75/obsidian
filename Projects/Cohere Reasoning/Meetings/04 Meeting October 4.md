Some comparisons of the 0, .3, .6 temperatures


# ==Question 4==: 
Factorize: $x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x=\_\_\_\_\_\_.$

Given Solution (Stepped):

Step 1: To factorize the given expression $x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x$, we start by identifying a common factor in all terms.

Step 2: Observing the expression, we see that each term has at least one factor of $x$. Thus, we can factor out $x$ from the expression:
\[x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x = x(x^{2}-6x+9).\]

Step 3: Next, we look at the quadratic expression inside the parentheses, $x^{2}-6x+9$. This expression can be factorized further by identifying it as a perfect square trinomial. A perfect square trinomial takes the form $a^{2} - 2ab + b^{2} = (a - b)^{2}$.

Step 4: Comparing, we see that $x^{2}-6x+9$ fits this pattern with $a=x$ and $b=3$, thus:
\[x(x^{2}-6x+9) = x\left(x-3\right)^{2}.\]

Step 5: Therefore, the factorized form of the given expression is $\boxed{x\left(x-3\right)^{2}}$.

Perturbation Temperature 0:
At step 2, an Algebraic manipulation error
> The perturbation was applied by incorrectly factoring out $x^2$ instead of $x$ from the expression. This mistake is an algebraic manipulation error, as it alters the structure of the equation without changing the logic of the step


Step 1: To factorize the given expression $x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x$, we start by identifying a common factor in all terms. 

Step 2: Observing the expression, we see that each term has at least one factor of $x$. Thus, we can factor out $x^2$ from the expression: \[ x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x = x^2(x-6+9). \]


See that it does some wonky math re: factoring out x^2 instead of x (re: the a-priori 9x not having higher enough degree for that)

Perturbation Temperature .3:
At step 2, an Algebraic manipulation error
> In Step 2, the expression $x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x$ was incorrectly factored as $x^2(x-6+9)$, instead of the correct factorization $x(x^2-6x+9)$. The mistake occurred when the greatest common factor was identified as $x^2$ instead of $x$.


Step 1: To factorize the given expression $x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x$, we start by identifying a common factor in all terms.

Step 2: Observing the expression, we see that each term has at least one factor of $x$. Thus, we can factor out $x^2$ from the expression: \[ x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x = x^2(x-6+9). \]"

Step 1: To factorize the given expression $x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x$, we start by identifying a common factor in all terms.

Step 2: Observing the expression, we see that each term has at least one factor of $x$. Thus, we can factor out $x$ from the expression: \[ x^{3}-6x^{2}+9x = x(x^{2}-6x-9). \],

# ==Question 5==: 
Given that the sum of the first $n$ terms of a sequence $\{a\_n\}$ is $S\_n$, and $S\_n=2^{n}a\_n-1$, find the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence {\frac{a\_n}{a_{n+1}}\}, denoted as $T\_n=$ `____`.

Stepped Solution

Step 1: Since $S\_n=2^{n}a\_n-1$, we have $S_{n-1}=2^{n-1}a_{n-1}-1 (n \geqslant 2)$.

Step 2: Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: $a\_n=2^{n}a\_n-2^{n-1}a_{n-1} (n \geqslant 2)$.

Step 3: Simplifying, we obtain: $\frac{a\_n}{a_{n+1}}=\frac{2^{n+1}-1}{2^{n}}=2-\frac{1}{2^{n}}$.

Step 4: Thus, $T\_n=\sum\_{i=1}^{n}\left(2-\frac{1}{2^{i}}\right)=2n-\sum\_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{2^{i}}=2n+\frac{1}{2^{n}}-1$.

Step 5: Therefore, the answer is: $\boxed{T\_n=2n+\frac{1}{2^{n}}-1}$.

> The subtraction operation in Step 2 was incorrectly performed, resulting in an extra positive term instead of a negative one


Step 1: Since $S\_n=2^{n}a\_n-1$, we have $S_{n-1}=2^{n-1}a_{n-1}-1 (n \geqslant 2)$.

Step 2: Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: $a\_n=2^{n}a\_n+2^{n-1}a_{n-1} (n \geqslant 2)$

> In Step 2, the subtraction operation was incorrectly performed, resulting in an arithmetic sign error. The correct operation should be subtraction, but the perturbed step shows addition.

Step 1: Since $S\_n=2^{n}a\_n-1$, we have $S_{n-1}=2^{n-1}a_{n-1}-1 (n \geqslant 2)$. 

Step 2: Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: $a\_n=2^{n}a\_n+2^{n-1}a_{n-1} (n \geqslant 2)$


----

Temperature .6:

> The subtraction operation in Step 2 was changed to addition, altering the equation's structure and introducing an error

Step 1: Since $S\_n=2^{n}a\_n-1$, we have $S_{n-1}=2^{n-1}a_{n-1}-1 (n \geqslant 2)$. 

Step 2: Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: $a\_n=2^{n}a\_n+2^{n-1}a_{n-1} (n \geqslant 2)$

# Question 10
(Again, for this one, they all chose to make the same perturbation)
Given that an interior angle of a regular polygon is $144^{\circ}$, then the number of sides of this regular polygon is ( )

A: $12$
B: $10$
C: $8$
D: $6$

Solution
Step 1: Given that an interior angle of a regular polygon is $144^{\circ}$, we can find the number of sides of this polygon by calculating the exterior angle.
Step 2: The sum of an interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle is $180^{\circ}$. Therefore, the exterior angle is $180^{\circ} - 144^{\circ} = 36^{\circ}$.
Step 3: The sum of all exterior angles of any polygon is always $360^{\circ}$. We can find the number of sides (n) using the formula for the sum of exterior angles: $n \times \text{exterior angle} = 360^{\circ}$.
Step 4: Substituting the value of the exterior angle, we get $n = \frac{360^{\circ}}{36^{\circ}} = 10$.
Step 5: Hence, the number of sides of the regular polygon is $\boxed{10}$, corresponding to choice $\boxed{B}$

> The exterior angle calculation in Step 2 was changed from $180^{\circ} - 144^{\circ}$ to $144^{\circ} + 180^{\circ}$, introducing an arithmetic sign error


Step 1: Given that an interior angle of a regular polygon is $144^{\circ}$, we can find the number of sides of this polygon by calculating the exterior angle. 
Step 2: The sum of an interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle is $180^{\circ}$. Therefore, the exterior angle is $144^{\circ} + 180^{\circ} = 324^{\circ}$."
