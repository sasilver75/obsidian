The birth of Convolutional Networks

Abstract Summary
> Multilayer Neural Networks trained with the backpropagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful GradientBased Learning technique. Given an appropriate network architectureGradientBased Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. ==Convolutional Neural Networks==that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of D shapes==are shown to outperform all other techniques==
