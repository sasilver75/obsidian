Paper: [Cross-Task Generalization via Natural Language Crowsourcing Instructions]()

- ==193k instruction-output examples== ==crowd-sourced== from ==61== existing NLP tasks.
- Crowd-sourcing instructions from each dataset are aligned to a *common schema*, so the instructions are more structured compared to other datasets.
- Outputs are relatively short, however, which makes the data less useful for generating long-form content.
