The inductive bias of a learning algorithm is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs. Learning is the process of searching a space of solutions for one that provides some best explanation of the data. Inductive biases allow learning algorithms to prioritize one solution/interpretation over another.
- e.g. step functions in [[Decision Tree]]s, rather than continuous functions in a linear regression model.
