Compare with [[Top-K Sampling]]: Top-k sampling samples tokens from those k with the highest probabilities (renormalizing probabilities and sampling) until the specified number of tokens is reached. In contrast, Top-p sampling samples tokens from the set of tokens having cumulative probability over some specified threshold value.
