The set of possible outcomes that satisfy our criteria for a specific [[Event]]; any subset of the set can be considered an [[Event]], which is made of [[Outcome]]s.

Event Condition: At least two of three dice are >=5
Event Space: 
{
(5,5,1), (5,5,2), (5,5,3), (5,5,4), (5,5,5), (5,5,6),
(5,6,1), (5,6,2), (5,6,3), (5,6,4), (5,6,5), (5,6,6),
(6,5,1), (6,5,2), (6,5,3), (6,5,4), (6,5,5), (6,5,6),
(6,6,1), (6,6,2), (6,6,3), (6,6,4), (6,6,5), (6,6,6)
}

((I'm not sure if I really need Event Space, or if we can just define an Event as any subset of [[Sample Space]])).
