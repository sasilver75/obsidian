Dataset developed by KAIST et al for the [[Prometheus 2]] paper; builds on [[Feedback Collection]], which was released together with [[Prometheus]].

While [[Feedback Collection]] was a *==direct assessment==* dataset (where an evaluator LM sees a single LM response and assigns a single scalar "score"), [[Preference Collection]] is instead a *==pairwise ranking==* dataset, where an evaluator LM ranks two LM responses.
