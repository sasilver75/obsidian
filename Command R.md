Blog post: [Introducing Tool Use with Command R: Seamlessly Automate Business Workflows](https://cohere.com/blog/tool-use-with-command-r)

A function-calling/tool-use/RAG model from Cohere.

Summary
> Our newest generative model,Â [Command R](https://cohere.com/blog/command-r/), comes with a Tool Use API that ==enables the language model to interact with user-defined tools== to automate highly sophisticated tasks.
> Outputs from the application are then ==fed back into Command R for it to generate a final response==. Responses come with citations, making it easy for users to trace back claims from the sourced data or results from the tools used. This advances Command R applications from simple chatbots to powerful agents and research tools for increased productivity.
> Tool Use (also known as ==function calling==) can also connect Command R seamlessly to external systems like databases, search engines, and any application that has an API to create automated workflows across multiple systems.
