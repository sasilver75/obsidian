A model is anything the agent uses to predict the environment's response to its actions.
- This might be an estimate of $p(s',r|s,a)$, the MDP distribution function.

Model-free methods are those without a model; they merely learn an association between states, actions and high rewards.


Examples
- [[Monte-Carlo Learning]]
- [[Temporal Difference Learning|TD-Learning]]
