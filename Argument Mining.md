A task in NLP focused on automatically identifying, extracting, and analyzing argumentative structures in text.
- Identifying argumentative text
- Component identification: Recognizing claims, premises, and conclusions
-  Determining how components relate to eachother

Challenges include ambiguity in natural language, context dependency, domain-specific argumentation styles, and implicit arguments and enthymemes (an argument in which a premise is not explicitly stated).
