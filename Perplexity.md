(Model measure)

==[[Perplexity]] is the reciprocal of the geometric mean of this sequence probability!==
	- ==Low perplexity== values indicate that a language model assigns *high* probability to textual sequences used for evaluation, and therefore fits the evaluation data *well*.
	- ==High perplexity== values indicate that a language model assigns *low* probability to textual sequences used for evaluation, and therefore fits the evaluation set *poorly*.
