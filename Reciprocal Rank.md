Comparing [[Success]] and [[Reciprocal Rank]]
Which of these is the best metric? It's not clear. For either of these metrics though, we really only care about *one star* (where the star here represents that some retrieved document is ground-truth *relevant* to a query). Compare this with metrics like [[Precision]] and [[Recall]], which care about more than one star.
