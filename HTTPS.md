Adds a security layer ([[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]/SSL) to encrypt communication, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. If you're building a public website, you're going to be using HTTPS without exception.

Generally speaking, this means that the contents of your HTTP requests and responses are safe in transit.
- Note that while the *contents* of your HTTP requests and responses are encrypted, they aren't guaranteed to have been generated by your client! Your API should never trust the contents of the request body without validating it.
- A common mistake is to include the user's ID in the request body and use it to make a database call; if an attacker can change the request body, they can change the User ID and read arbitrary user data; ouch!
- This doesn't mean that you can't include user IDs in your requests; it just means that you need to be able to validate them on the server and your API shouldn't ask for anything that you can't trust.
