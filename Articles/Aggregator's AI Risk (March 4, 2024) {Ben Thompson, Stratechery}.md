----

A recurring theme on Stratechery is that the only technology analogous to the Internet's impact on humanity is the printing press, which drastically reduced the marginal cost of printing books, increasing the amount of information that could be disseminated.
- But you still had to actually put in the labor of writing the book. With all the costs, there were strong incentives to produce popular books.
- Before the printing press:
	- The Bible was the province of the Catholic Church, only available in latin, and laboriously reproduced by Monks.
	- Europe didn't have any nation-states as we think of them today.
	- The linguistic landscape was extremely diverse.

The printing press was a direct assault on that last point -- because it still cost money to produce a book, it made sense to print books in the most dominant dialect in the region. Over time, this meant the dominant dialect increased its dominance in a virtual cycle.

## Aggregation Theory
- In this view, the internet is the final frontier -- publishing and distribution were now zero-marginal-cost activities, just like consumption.
- The economic change of this his Newspapers first: Newspapers were now able to reach audiences not just in their hometowns, but all over the world -- but their advertising revenues fell off a cliff. Their financial prospects these days are inversely correlated to their addressable markets.
- In a world defined by scarcity, those who control the scarce resources have the power to set the price for access to those resources -- but on the internet, it's a world of abundance -- the new power that matters is the ability to make *sense* of that abundance, index it, and find needles in that haystack (Google).
- This is ==[Aggregation Theory](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/),== which explained why the internet wasn't just the final state of the printing press world, but the start of a new order, with new centers of power on the west coast of the United States. These powers didn't control *distribution,* but rather *discovery*, in a world marked not by *scarcity,* but *abundance!*

Aggregators become quite politically powerful; people complain about Google and Meta, but their revealed preference is that they aren't particularly interested in finding alternatives, in part because network effects make it all but impossible for alternatives to be as attractive. And so, ==over the last two decades, we've drifted to a world still organized by nation states, but with a parallel political economy defined by American tech companies. ==


## Internet 3.0: Politics
- It's long been in the Aggregator's interest to *eschew* politics; because their economics depend on serving everyone -- but they still have a political impact.
- Facebook could be the most potent political force in the world, until said meddling was uncovered, at which point the service (having significantly betrayed users' trust) would lose a substantial number of users, leading to a plunge in market value.
	- In short, ==there are no incentives for Facebook to explicitly favor any type of content beyond that which drives deeper engagement.== Evidences suggests that Facebook agrees.
- Facebook's reticence though creates a curious dynamic in politics in particular: there's no dominant force when it comes to the dispersal of political information. All news sources are competing on an equal footing -- those controlled or bought by a party aren't inherently privileged.  Posts "break out" not when they come from specific accounts, but when users are receptive to hearing that message. By extension, ==the most successful politicians in an aggregated world are not those who serve the party, but rather those who tell voters what they most want to hear.==
	- In this view, blaming Facebook explicitly for the election of Donald Trump made no sense -- in a world of infinite competition, Trump provided ratings from his fans and enemies alike; it was ==television== (and some newspapers) that propelled him to the white house -- in part because *their incentives* in an Aggregator-organized world were were to give him ever more attention.

Concerns over Facebook's power were slightly mollified by their investing billions of dollars in combatting "misinformation," but January 6 laid the Aggregator's power bare, when ==they muzzled the sitting president.==
- It's also true that Indian leaders can be silenced by an unreachable and unaccountable executive in San Francisco; it's reasonable that countries will find this status quo unacceptable.

## The Aggregator's AI Problem
- Meta's Imagine AI image generator over-corrected on diversity, and produced problematic results. Meta immediately disabled the feature, afraid to have another Gemeni moment.
- Remember that Aggregator power comes from controlling demand, and that their economic model depends on demand being universal; ==the ability to control demand as a function of providing a discovery mechanism for the abundance of supply.==
- But no company can satisfy everyone; *every action* can be interpreted as a moral or political action.
- ==The ability for AI to scale to everyone does in many respects pose a risk for the Aggregators. On one hand, costs are going up (in terms of compute and data), and customers that disagree with the AI's morals will be heavily incentivized to go elsewhere.==
	- Users deciding to go somewhere else is the only thing that can bring an Aggregator down -- or at least significantly impair their margins.

## Personalized AIs
- Google and Meta in particular, though, could do more than that: these are companies whose business model — personalized advertising — is predicated on understanding at a very deedp level what every single person is interested in on an individual basis. Moreover, that personalization goes into the product experience as well: your search results are affected by your past searches and personalized profile, as is your feed in Meta’s various products. ==It certainly seems viable that the prompt could also be personalized==.
- Imagine if Google had an entire collection of system prompts that mapped onto the Topics API (transparently posted, of course): ==the best prompt for the user would be selected based on what the user has already showed an interest in== (along with other factors like where they are located, preferences, etc.). This would transform the AI from being a sole source of truth dictating supply to the user, to one that gives the user what they want — which is exactly how Aggregators achieve market power in the first place.
