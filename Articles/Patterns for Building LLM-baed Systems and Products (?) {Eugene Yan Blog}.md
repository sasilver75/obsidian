Note: I think this is going to be pretty similar to [[What we learned from a Year of Building with LLMs (Part 1) (May 28, 2024) {Eugene Yan, Bryan Bischof, Charles Frye, Hamel Husain, Jason Liu, Shreya Shankar}]] , which also included Eugene as an author.

This write-up is about practical patterns for integrating LLMs into systems and products; we'll build on:
- Academic Research
- Industry Resources
- Practitioner Know-How
and distill them into key ideas and practices


We're going to talk about ==Seven Key Patterns==:
1. ==Evals==: To measure performance
2. ==RAG==: To add recent, external knowledge
3. ==Fine-tuning==: To get better at specific tasks
4. ==Caching==: to reduce latency and cost
5. ==Guardrails==: To ensure output quality
6. ==Defensive UX:== To anticipate and manage errors gracefully
7. ==Collecting user feedback==: To build our data flywheel
