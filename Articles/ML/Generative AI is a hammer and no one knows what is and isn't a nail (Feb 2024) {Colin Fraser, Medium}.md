Imagine a world without hammers
- Driving nails into the wall with your bare fists
- Kicking through drywall with your foot to take down a wall
- Tying your text stake to a rock to stop it from flying away in the wind

Imagine this world has a long history of scientific research, as well as a tradition of speculative science fiction and futurism centered around the concept of "Artificial Labor" (AL).

One day, it's anticipated that AL will drive your nails, tear down your walls, and stake your tent ðŸ˜±â›º
In the far future, Artificial General Labor (AGL) will wash the dishes, do the laundry, walk the dog, pickup the kids from school, and essentially do every annoying laborious task you can imagine, freeing you from a life of drudgery.

A company called OpenAL, then, ~"invents" the hammer.
- We can suddenly drive nails much faster and more effectively than ever before.
- Thousands of AL-first technology firms materialize out of nowhere to do things like stake down tents using the latest AL tools from OpenAL.
- Independent hackers figure out how to build their own hammers from materials lying around the house, publishing their instructions online for free.

For many people, it seems like we're on our way to a WALL-E AGL scenario -- OpenAL even says that it's their whole purpose to bring this AGL about!

But wait a second -- in the WALL-E scenario, AL is doing the dishes... but hammers can't do dishes, right?
- Well... Hammer4 looks pretty good... some people are saying that maybe Hammer5 will be able to do it! Because Hammer5 will cost many trillions of dollars to construct.


If you're not getting it yet, he's suggesting that ==ChatGPT was like the release of the hammer==; huge generative models like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion Sora, etc. are a new and surprising subcategory of AI technology with a wide and rapidly-expanding range of potential uses.

==But there are some things that ChatGPT seems to be quite bad at, which we wouldn't think were very difficult for either humans or traditional computers programs== (he shows the "sum to 22" game, where you take turns picking numbers 1-7, and whoever gets the number to 22 wins).

The most common point of view about the trajectory of AI among people who are into AI is that "*if there is something like the sum-to-22 game that the AI can't do today, surely it will be able to do it very soon! It's just a matter of time!*"

#### There's no one thing called "AI"
- AI is a huge and fuzzy category comprising everything from chess engines to search engines to facial recognition to robot dogs to the operating system from the movie *Her*.
- Technologies in the AI category all have different things that they *can* and *cannot* do.

AI is too broad and fuzzy to cleanly decompose into a proper hierarchy, but there are a few ways to impose a messy order on it.

At the broadest level, ==there's maybe a distinction between Symbolic AI and Machine Learning==

Under ML, you might have some subcategories like Classifiers or Recommenders, and one of these subcategories might be Generative AI. One of the categories below *this* might be LLM-based generation systems, of which ChatGPT is one example.

The point the author is trying to make is that ==ChatGPT is just one little point in a vast universe of technologies, somewhat analogously to how a hammer is one example from the general class of *tools*==

Frequently, reporting/media will collapse this huge category into a single amorphous entity.

A ==casual observer might reasonably surmise from these headlines that scientists at DeepMind are in possession of something called "an AI"== that is capable of doing all these various things.
And perhaps this AI at DeepMind is fundamentally the same sort of entity as ==ChatGPT, which also introduces itself as "an AI."==

All of this makes it seem like "an AI" is a discrete kind of thing that's manning chat bots, solving unsolved math problems, and beating high schoolers at geometry Olympiads -- but that isn't remotely the case!
- FunSearch, AlphaGeometry, and ChatGPT are three completely different kind of technologies which do three completely different kinds of things that are not at all interchangeable or even interoperable!

Something all three of these technologies have in common is that they are built using LLMs, and more generally that they are applications of this explosive new paradigm called Generative AI.
- This may make it seem like they are more connected than they actually are -- but they're extremely different applications of LLM.

There are many different things that count as "AI", and they all have very different properties.
- By sloppily mixing them, a picture is painted of a kind of system that doesn't actually exist, with an array of capabilities that no one thing has.

### A universal text generator is a universal hammer
- I can feel some people reading this post screaming that ChatGPT and a hammer is a category error -- hammers do just one thing -- hit things! ChatGPT on the other hand, generates text, *the universal interface* to a large variety of problems -- it's a *general* intelligence, right?
- But lurking below the surface of this is a very strong assumption -- ==the assumption that ChatGPT can generate *any* kind of text== -- and that all of the text necessary to perform any task can be generated by the specific procedure that ChatGPT uses to generate text.
- ==Strictly speaking, it's trivially false -- There's no way that ChatGPT can output the first billion decimal digits of $\pi$ , for example -- that's just not the type of task to which *its particular approach to generating text is suited*, but it's possible that this is the needed answer to a problem!==
	- My point is that there obviously exists at least one text generation task -- namely, this one -- that a system like ChatGPT cannot be expected to do -- there are *non-nails* to ChatGPT's hammer!

The dominant view still is that "scale is all you need" -- that all it takes to build something that's good at that task is more computing power.
- In other words, this party thinks: =="If today's hammer can't do the dishes, all we need is a larger one!"==
	- There is at least one task -- outputting the decimal digits of $\pi$ that this kind of system can't do even in theory.

==It's clear that *artificial labor* can do many of these problematic tasks -- the question is whether a *hammer* can!==
