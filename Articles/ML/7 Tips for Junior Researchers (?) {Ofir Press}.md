# Research

1. Research is hard and involves a tremendous amount of failure. It's normal to feel like you din't make progress in the past week, month, or year.
	- When you read a paper, the finding is frequently presented as some *obvious step* that's the result of a seemingly short exploration; But when you actually do research, you might realize that good results *never* just fall into your hands -- they're the result of many failed experiments that did not work!
	- Despite this, you can learn a lot from failing -- eventually, you'll learn enough (and be lucky enough) ti have an idea that actually works!

2. Don't ever lie, make up results, or sweep negative findings under the rug
	- These things might help you in the short term, but in the long term they never will.
	- If you run an experiment with 4 random seeds, and in one the improvement is 10%, and in the other three the improvements are -2%, 1%, and -9%, then your 10% was just a fluke. You could submit a paper and not mention the others, but that would be deceitful!

3. Focusing is important, especially in the beginning
	- Some junior researchers are afraid to pick one project and stick to it, instead preferring to simultaneously work multiple projects, with the explanation being that they're not sure which project will pan out, so they want to try multiple projects at once.
	- This logic is flawed! Good research requires intense focus; pick one direction that you're most excited about and focus on it. As you keep working on it, you'll evolve, pivot, and change many times into many different directions.

# Working with a mentor

1. It's okay (and even recommended) to say "I don't understand you."
	- When we start doing research, we usually do it with an advisor who's much more senior than us -- a professor in grad school, or maybe a PhD student if you're in undergrad.
	- Sometimes the advisor will say something very complicated that's totally incomprehensible; when this happens, you can't be afraid to say "I don't understand!"
	- Good researchers understand this and are open to explaining their thoughts, and re-explaining.
	- Good researchers also know that explaining new ideas to different people helps us better frame our thoughts and understand how to write them in paper.

2. It's okay to say "I don't know"
	- We're all doing research, since we don't know a lot of things and trying to figure them out together, saying "I don't know" doesn't make you seem stupid, it makes you seem honest.

3. It's okay (and recommended) to say "I don't agree with you."
	- Progress in research is partially driven by disagreements. There any many possible paths to solve an issue; if everyone worked on the same ideas, it would be horrible!
	- Never say something like "that's a dumb idea" or anything close to that -- find respectful ways of voicing disagreement.

4. Your advisor doesn't have all the answers.
	- Doing research is a multi-faceted endeavor, with many different questions to answer.
	- What problems are currently relevant and exciting to the community?
		- Which ones are the best fit for me?
			- What's the high-level plan for solving this problem?
				- How can I best execute that plan?
					- Once we have a solution, what's the best framing for it?
						- How can I best market my solution?
	- Some of these questions might not be easily answerable by your senior collaborator.
	- A common setup for authorship:
		- PhD Student: Does the work
		- Professor co-author: Provides high-level feedback on the story and framing
		- Postdoc/Research scientist: Provides low-level feedback about implementation details
