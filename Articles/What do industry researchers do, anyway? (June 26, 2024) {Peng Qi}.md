Author has been an industry researcher (AWS AI, prev. JD.COM) for ~3.5 years.
He did a PhD in CS at Stanford, and a research-focused Masters before that, and even did some undergraduate research.

So you're an incoming, current, or nearly-done PhD student -- maybe you're looking into pursuing further academia, but you can't help wondering -- would the grass be greener on the other side?

## The less-talked-about similarities between academic and industry research
- Both academic jobs and industry jobs are just that -- jobs. Freshly-minted PhDs are usually equally surprised by the job-like natures of these occupations.
	- You don't work alone anymore! You work with a number of other people towards a shared goal, and they would sometimes depend on you for resources, output, time commitments, or all of the above. You'll spend a lot more energy making *predictions of your own output*, and well as making sure that you communicate that progress.
	- Most research projects are resource intensive, and private companies can't fund everything that comes to everyone's mind. As a result, we usually gravitate towards "past performance predicts future success," and use the heuristic of people's track record. ==This makes successes and failures in research jobs feel more consequential than in the handful of papers you publish as a PhD student,== since you're no longer shielded by the great buffer that was your advisor.
	- ==The chances you work with domain experts in your day-to-day likely diminishes==! You're likely exposed to people with different backgrounds, many of which are non-experts.
		- ==In both these cases, the ability to communicate with someone outside your tribe and jargons becomes very important to get the point across, to manage expectations, and to meet them where they are.==

## Two roads diverging in a wood: where academic and industry research jobs differ
- Academia and industry have different definitions of goals.
	- Academia is about pursuing original knowledge, and that's the end goal in and of itself. This means you have more freedom to pursue things that help us *understand* things better (but not necessarily do them better), or that are scrappy and don't extrapolate well.
	- Industry is always trying to put things in the hands of actual people, in the long run. Often a reduced emphasis on originality.
- Academia and industry have different measures of impact
	- Academia often cares about how much new research is enabled by your work. You might stick to your challenging problem for years, until fruition.
	- Industry typically focuses on "how many people or $ are effected, and how soon?" If something isn't making progress, it's easier in research labs to ramp up resources and throw it at the problem.
- Academia and industry have different scales of operation and connection to real users
	- In academia, PhD students often play "full-stack engineers," or equivalents in their own research projects -- but there's only so much a single person can do in 8-hour workdays, and users need more than a scrappy prototype.
	- In industry, you work with a number of experienced and talented folks in different areas that you could never hope to match. Industry has products that real people use and give feedback on. There's a responsibility -- the demands of the user are more important than a careful research solution, which can be hard to grapple with.
