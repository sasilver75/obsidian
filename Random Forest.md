Abstract
> Random forests are a ==combination of tree predictors== such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. ==The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large==. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that ==compare favorably to Adaboost==.
