The **transpose** of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix **A** by producing another matrix, often denoted by $A^T$.

$(A^T)^T = A$

The transpose of a matrix A can be obtained by reflecting the elements across its main diagonal. Repeating the process on the transposed matrix returns the elements to their original positions.
