# Networking
- Recommendation: Read "High Performance Browser Networking", and then "Computer Networking, a Top-Down Approach (6th edition or later)".
- "Networking Basics for Hackers" might also be interesting, and there's Beej's guide to network programming, which is a hands-on course.
- People also seem to like "The Illustrated Network" (The author of this one was inspired by the older "TCP/IP Illustrated" book, and tried to write this as a modern equivalent.)
- In terms of video resources
	- HN guy recommended KeithBarker on Youtube
