In is ==fine-grained, [[Unstructured Pruning]]==, the pruning looks completely random; we can have the most flexibility to prune our model, but it's hard to hardware accelerate, because it's irregular, which hardware doesn't like.

So there's a very broad spectrum of pruning regularity for convolutional operations.
