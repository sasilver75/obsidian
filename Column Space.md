Also called the Range or Image of a Matrix, the Column Space of a matrix A is the [[Span]] (set of all possible linear combinations) of its column vectors.
- If a 3d transform has non-zero determinant and its output fills all of 3D space, it has a rank of 3. This set of all possible outputs for your matrix, whether it's a line, plane, or 3D space; is called the "column space" of your matrix.

Note that the [[Rank (Linear Algebra)]] of a transformation is the span of the columns in your matrix.
