A technique to design an optimize NN architectures by searching through a predefined space of possible architectures to find the most effective one for a given task.

Key aspects:
1. Search Space: Defining the set of possible NN architectures that can be explored
2. Search Strategy: The method used to navigate the search space (eg RL, evolutionary algorithms, or gradient-based optimization)
3. Performance estimation: Some method of evaluating the performance of a candidate architecture, which often involves training and validating on a subset of data.
