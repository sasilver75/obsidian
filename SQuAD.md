[SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250)

A classic question-answering dataset

Note: ==[[SQuAD v2]] (2018)== exists too.

Abstract
> We present the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), a new ==reading comprehension dataset consisting of 100,000+ questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles==, where the ==answer to each question is a segment of text from the corresponding reading passage==. We analyze the dataset to understand the types of reasoning required to answer the questions, leaning heavily on dependency and constituency trees. We build a strong logistic regression model, which achieves an F1 score of 51.0%, a significant improvement over a simple baseline (20%). However, human performance (86.8%) is much higher, indicating that the dataset presents a good challenge problem for future research.
