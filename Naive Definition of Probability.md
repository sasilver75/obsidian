The ==[[Naive Definition of Probability]]== (which can only be used when you have strong justification for doing so) is that the probability of an event A, P(A) is equal to (# of possible favorable outcomes / # of possible outcomes).
- So if we flip a coin twice, there are four possible outcomes. The sample space is $\{(H,H), (H,T), (T,H), (T,T)\}$ ... and so we have a 1/4 chance of $(H,H)$. We didn't say if it was a "fair" coin or not.
	- This is an example where it's straightforward to count the number of possible outcomes; the size of the sample space. But for many problems this isn't easy to do!
- ==This definition assumes that all outcomes are equally likely== (a ***very strong assumption*** in many problems), and that we have some finite sample space (with which to use as our denominator).%%  %%

The key when solving problems is to phrase your solution so that every Outcome in the [[Sample Space]] has an equal probability of occurring. Then we can just solve the problem using counting rules and the [[Naive Definition of Probability]] by computing $|EventSpace|/|Sample Space|$.
