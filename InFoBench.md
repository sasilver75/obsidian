  - Instruction Following Benchmark
---
Evaluates instruction following capability using a new metric called ==Decomposed Requirements Following Ratio (DRFR)==, which breaks down complex instructions into simpler criteria and facilitates analysis of an LLM's compliance to these decomposed tasks in detail. The benchmark has 500 diverse instructions and 2250 decomposed questions across multiple constraint categories.
