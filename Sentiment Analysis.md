A NLP task in which we determine the emotional sentiment behind a body of text, for example whether the writer's attitude in a body of text as positive, negative, or neutral.

Comes in various levels of granularity:
- Binary: Positive or Negative
- Fine-grained: Very positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very negative
- Aspect-based: Identifying the sentiment associated with specific aspects or features of a product/service/topic, rather than just the overall sentiment of the entire text.
- Emotion detection: Identifying specific emotions (joy, anger, sadness, etc.)

Challenges include sarcasm and irony detection, context-dependency, domain-specific language use, multilinguality, and multimodality.
