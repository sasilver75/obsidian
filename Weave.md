From [[Weights and Biases]], a suite of tools for developing and productionizing AI applications. Seems like it serves a similar function as [[LangSmith]].

Use Weave to:
- Log and debug language model inputs, outputs, and traces (eg in the case of tool use, retrieval)
- Build suites of rigorous, apples-to-apples evaluations for LM use cases
- Organize all information generated across the LM workflow, from experimentation to evaluations and production.
