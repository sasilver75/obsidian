  - POS Tagging
---
A task in NLP in which each word in a text is marked with its corresponding part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.

Common POS tags include noun (NN), verb (VB), adjective (JJ), adverb (RB), pronoun (PRP), preposition (IN), conjunction (CC), and interjection (UH).

It's a fundamental part of many NLP tasks like syntactic parsing, [[Named Entity Recognition|NER]], [[Machine Translation|MT]], and [[Information Retrieval|IR]]

Challenges include word ambiguity (is "book" a verb or noun).
