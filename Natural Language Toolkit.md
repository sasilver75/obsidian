aliases:
  - NLTK
---
A comprehensive Python library for NLP tasks, including tokenization.

Offers a wide range of tokenizers, like `word_tokenize` and `sent_tokenize`, making it a popular choice for educational and research purposes. 

Straightforward and easy to use, making it an accessible option for beginners in the field.

Example of use
```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# "download" the Pubkt Sentence Tokenizer 
# Punkt divides text into a list of sentence
nltk.download('punkt')

# Tokenize some text with it
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
```

Under the hood, NLTK's `word_tokenize` uses a set of regular expressions to identify token boundaries. The function then returns a list of the identified tokens, preserving the original order and structure of the input text. But it can struggle with handling more complex linguistic phenomenon such as contradictions, abbreviations, or special characters. But it can be useful for tasks like word frequency analysis, bag-of-words modeling, and basic text classification.
