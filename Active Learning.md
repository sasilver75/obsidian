- Given an unlabeled dataset $U$ and a fixed amount of labeling cost $B$, [[Active Learning]] aims to select a subset of $B$ examples from $U$ to be labeled, such that they can result in maximized improvement in model performance.
	- This is an effective way of learning, especially when data labeling is difficult and costly (e.g. medical images).
