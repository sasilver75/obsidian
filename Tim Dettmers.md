"Before my PhD, I worked in the automation industry (factory automation) -- mostly food/milk factories. I specialized in integrating systems, integrating their data systems, and routing data.... making data accessible to a person who controls all machines, or to management that gets aggregated reports of performance."

"Dyslexics like me are known for having bad working memory. I'm in the bottom 5% for working memory related to symbols..."

"Quantization is kind of solved. We need to move on to different problems (is an 8bit-16bit person)"
