[ChatNoir Resiliparse documentation](https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/stable/)

A text extraction library that performs a similar duty to [[Trafilatura]] (and, according to the [[DataComp-LM]] paper, at the ~same performance), but is 8x faster to run and hence more practical for large-scale processing.
