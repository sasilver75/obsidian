I volunteered to do a little presentation on a few RAG survey papers for the next LatentSpace paper club. This is where I'm going to be putting some of the interesting notes from those papers.

Papers include:
1. [[Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models - A Survey]] (Gao et al.; March 27, 2024)
2. [[Retrieval-Augmented Generation for AI-Generated Content - A Survey]] (Zhao et al; May 2, 2024)
3. [[RAG and RAU - A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Language Model in Natural Language Processing]] (Hu et al; April 30, 2024)

TODO:
- Develop a timeline of good RAG papers, and short summaries on each
-
