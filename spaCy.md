A modern, efficient NLP library prioritizing speed and performance; provides advanced tokenization capabilities accounting for linguistic structure and content, making it a preferred choice for production-ready applications.

More sophisticated tokenization than [[Natural Language Toolkit|NLTK]], able to handle complex cases like contractions and providing additional linguistic annotations.

Example of use of spaCy tokenization
```python
import spacy

# Convenience fn that uses language and pipeline information to construct a Language object, loads in model data/weights, and returns it.
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Invoke our tokenizer on some text
doc = nlp("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")

# Etract the .text attribute from the iterable 
tokens = [token.text for token in doc]
```
SpaCy's approach is more sophisticated than NLTK's simple world-level tokenization. Instead of relying solely on whitespace and punctuation, spaCy's tokenizer takes a more comprehensive approach that accounts for the linguistic structure of the input text. Also preserves information about the original whitespace and punctuation, which can be useful for downstream tasks that require preserving the formatting and layout of the text. Highly efficient and performant, making it a suitable choice for *real-world NLP applications* that need to process large volumes of text data. The library's modular architecture allows for easy integration with other components of its comprehensive NLP pipeline, like part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.
