In the last 10 years or so, we've had a massive explosion of Deep RL (kudos Deepmind/AlphaGo demonstrations).

We use deep neural networks to learn a model (where we can then use [[Model-Based]] RL, or to represent [[Model-Free]] concepts (eg a DNN for the policy function, or the value function, etc.)
