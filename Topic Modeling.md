A task in NLP in which we aim to discover abstract *topics* that occur within a collection of documents, where *topics* are clusters of words that appear frequently together.

Often framed as an unsupervised learning problem, where we try to identify the topic clusters, document-topic distribution (P(topic|document)) and topic-word distribution (P(word|topic)).

Algorithms historically include [[Latent Dirichlet Allocation]] (LDA), probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA), etc.
