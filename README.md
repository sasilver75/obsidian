# Obsidian

This is my attempt to create a knowledge base of ML using Obsidian.
My concept for now is just to have single pages for all of vocabulary, papers, articles, and videos,
and to link them to eachother via bidirectional links. They pages are tagged to denote their type.

The hope is to create Anki flashcards from them using an Obsidian plugin.
