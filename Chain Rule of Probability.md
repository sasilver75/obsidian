For two non-independent events A and B, the chain rule states that
$P(A \cap B) = P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)$ 

It allows us to decompose the joint probability distribution (of *any* sort, no assumptions) into the product of some number of conditional probabilities.
This seems to basically be the non-independent version of [[Multiplication Rule of Probability]].

From two "routes" of the Chain Rule of Probability, we can easily derive [[Bayes Theorem]].
