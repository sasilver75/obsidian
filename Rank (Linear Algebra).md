The rank of a transformation is the [[Span]] of the columns in your matrix, or, more loosely/colloquially, the number of dimensions in the output of a transformation.
- When the output of a transformation is a one-dimensional line, we say the transform has a rank of 1.
- When all the vectors land on a two-dimensional plane, we say the transformation has a rank of 2.
- If a 3d transform has a non-zero determinant and its output fills all of 3D space, it has a rank of 3.
