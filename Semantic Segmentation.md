This technique labels each pixel in an image with a class of objects (e.g., car, dog, or house). ==However, it doesn't distinguish between different instances of an object==. For example, if there are three cars in an image, all of them would be labeled as "car" without distinguishing between car 1, car 2, and car 3.
