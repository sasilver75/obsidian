Refers to algorithms used to find optimal policies which have *complete knowledge* of the environment as an MDP

In other words, DP has access to:  $p(s',r|s,a)$  ... which is an unrealistic assumption, most of the time.

To exploit this, we use a universal concept in the world of sequential decision making: The [[Bellman Equation]] (for the value function).
