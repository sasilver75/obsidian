"*Quantization is the process of constraining an input from a continuous or otherwise large set of values to a discrete set.*"

Quantization refers to the process of reducing the number of bits that are used to represent a model's parameters, weights, and/or activations. The goal is to decrease the model's size and increase its inference speed, making it more efficient for deployment (or training) on resource-constrained devices.

Benefits:
- Reduced model size
- Increase inference speed
- Lower power consumption

Challenges:
- Accuracy degradation
- Hardware support (efficient execution of certain quantization schemes might require hardware supporting lower-precision arithmetic operations)
