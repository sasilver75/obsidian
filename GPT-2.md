Paper: [Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf)

OpenAI's second language model in the GPT series; notable because we learned about zero-shot generalization to all sorts of interesting tasks (eg [[Question Answering]]).

1.5B parameter transformer model trained on [[Webtext]] 

Interesting paper bits:
- Page 4 has some tips on doing [[Byte-Pair Encoding]] (BPE)
- Page 8 has some cool information on using [[Bloom Filter]]s to check for test contamination.

Abstract
> Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that ==language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages== called ==WebText==. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples.
> The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of ==zero-shot task transfer== and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, ==GPT-2,== is a ==1.5B parameter== Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits ==WebText==. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.

Examples of machine translation being inherently present in large scale datasets -- even the language labels and the problem framing!

- The four sizes of LMs that were trained in the paper, with the largest being called GPT-2. We can see that we basically got SoTA perplexity and accuracy results on almost every dataset.

- We can see that the language modeling objective resulted in a bunch of world knowledge being incorporated into the model. We see that it knows that Janet Yellen appoints the chair of the Fed...  but what happens when she leaves that position? How do we update the model without expensive retraining? This is one of the reasons why we like RAG, which separates knowledge and understanding.
- GPT-2 answered "only" 4.1% of questions correctly when evaluated by an exact match metric, but on the 1% of questions it was most confident in, it got 63.1%.
