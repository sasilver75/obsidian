Paper: [ClueWeb22: 10 Billion Web Documents with Visual and Semantic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15848)


Abstract
> ClueWeb22, the newest iteration of the ClueWeb line of datasets, ==provides 10 billion web pages affiliated with rich information==. Its design was influenced by the need for a high quality, large scale web corpus to support a range of academic and industry research, for example, in information systems, retrieval-augmented AI systems, and model pretraining. Compared with earlier ClueWeb corpora, the ClueWeb22 corpus is larger, more varied, of higher-quality, and aligned with the document distributions in commercial web search. Besides raw HTML, ClueWeb22 ==includes rich information about the web pages provided by industry-standard document understanding systems, including the visual representation of pages rendered by a web browser, parsed HTML structure information from a neural network parser, and pre-processed cleaned document text to lower the barrier to entry==. Many of these signals have been widely used in industry but are available to the research community for the first time at this scale.
