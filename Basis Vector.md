When we describe a vector like (3, -2). we think of each coordinate as a scalar that stretches or squishes its corresponding dimension's basis vector (eg $\hat{i}$ or $\hat{j}$).
- In an xy-coordinate system, two special vectors are that pointing right with length 1 ("i hat", or $\hat{i}$), and that pointing straight up with length 1 ("j hat", or $\hat{j}$).

==The technical definition for the “basis” of a space is a set of *linearly independent* vectors that [[Span]] that space.==
