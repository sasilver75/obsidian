The set of all possible vectors that you can reach with linear combinations of a given pair of vectors is called the span of those two vectors. In other words, all the possible vectors you can reach by only using the fundamental operations of *vector addition* and *scalar multiplication.*
- The span of *most* pairs of 2D vectors is all vectors in 2D space, but when they line up, their span is all vectors whose tips sit on a certain line.

Spans of course also apply in multiple additional dimensions.
When we consider (eg) a third vector, we're often interested in whether that vector in ==linearly (in)dependent== on the other vectors. When you have multiple vectors and you can remove one without reducing the span (ie the third vector was as sitting on the span of the first two), we say that the vectors are "linearly dependent."
- ==Analogously, we can say that if one of the vectors can be expressed as a combination of the others, then it's already in the span of the other two, and is linearly dependent.==

Note:
**The technical definition for the “==basis==” of a space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span that space. Given how we described a basis earlier, and given your understanding of the words “span” and “linearly independent”, this definition makes sense!**
