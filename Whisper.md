Abstract
> We study the capabilities of ==speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet==. When scaled to ==680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervision==, the resulting models generalize well to standard benchmarks and are often competitive with prior fully supervised results but in a zero-shot transfer setting without the need for any fine-tuning. When compared to humans, the models approach their accuracy and robustness. We are releasing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for further work on robust speech processing.
