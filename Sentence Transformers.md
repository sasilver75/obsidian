Sentence Transformers: Multilingual Sentence, Paragraph, and Image Embeddings using BERT & Co.
- A framework for providing an easy method to compute dense vector representations for sentences, paragraphs, and images. The models are based on transformer networks like [[Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers|BERT]], [[RoBERTa]], XLM-RoBERTa, etc.
- Text is embedded in vector space such that similar text are closer, and can efficiently be found using cosine similarity.
