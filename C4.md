A cleaned subset of the CommonCrawl dataset.
C4 is made by Google using a few heruristics. 
It's about 10% of CommonCrawl, and tries to filter by different ways:
- Uses an open source list of dirty/bad/naughty words, created by Shutterstock.
- Lots of stuff didn't get filtered out; certain pieces of 4Chan, Kiwiforums, 


Lots of models will use both C4 and CommonCrawl as their training.
