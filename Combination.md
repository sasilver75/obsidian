A combination is an *==unordered==* selection of $k$ objects from a set of $n$ *==distinct==* objects.
- Example: How many ways could I select $k$ people from a group of $n$ to receive cake?

$n! / (k!(n-k)!)$  , which can also be written as $n \choose k$

Fun fact: $n \choose k$ = $n \choose n-k$

This equation shows up so often that it gets its own notation, which is called the [[Binomial Coefficient]]

(Where these humans are distinct)

Let's say there are 6 distinct books, and I want to choose 3? (So the ordering doesn't matter).
The answer here is just $6 \choose 3$ = 6!/3!3! = 20
- Get all my books in a line
- Draw a cutoff at 3
- Permute each group
Or... just recognize it as a combination problem, where you're choosing some unordered collection of distinct objects from a large pool!
