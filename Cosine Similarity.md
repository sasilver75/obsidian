Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors, defied in terms of the *cosine of the angle between them.* It's used often to measure document similarity in text analysis.

The cosine of the angle can be also determined as the [[Dot Product]] of the vectors, divided by the product of their lengths.

Cosine similarities always belong to the interval \[-1, 1\].
- Two proportional vectors have a cosine similarity of 1.
- Two orthogonal vectors have a cosine similarity of 0.
- Two opposite vectors have a similarity of -1.
