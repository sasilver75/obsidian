A theorem stating that the average of results obtained from a large number of independent random samples converges to the true value, if it exists.
- Specifically, given a sample of IID values, the sample mean converges to the true mean.

It's important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events.
- While a casino may lose money in a single spin of the roulette wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any player's winning streak will *eventually* be overcome by the parameters of the game (when a large number of observations are considered).

A good example of the LLN is the [[Monte-Carlo]] family of methods, which rely on repeated sampling to obtain numerical estimations. The larger the number of repetitions, the better the approximation tends to be.
