Github: ["A Python package and command-line tool to gather text on the web"](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
`Trafilatura` includes discovery, extractions, and text-processing components. Its main applications are web crawling, downloads, scraping, and extraction of main texts, metadata, and comments.
- It aims at staying handy and modular; no database is required, and output can be converted to commonly-used formats.

This library consistently outperforms other open-source libraries in text-extraction benchmarks, showcasing its efficiency and accuracy in extracting web content.
