## Chi-Squared Test
- A statistical test for categorical data, used to determine whether there is a significant association between two ==categorical== variables, commonly used in hypothesis testing, and useful for large sample sizes.
- The chi-squared test is a ==non-parametric test==, meaning it *does not assume a specific distribution for the data*, making it widely applicable in various fields.
- Two main types:
	1. Chi-Squared Test of Independence
		- Used to determine if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables (eg between gender and voting preference).
	2. Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit Test
		- Used to determine if a sample data matches a population with a specific distribution. For example, can be used to test if a die is far by comparing observed frequencies of the die rolls to expected frequencies.

## Chi-Squared Distribution
- Probability distribution that arises in the context of chi-squared tests and other statistical analyses. A continuous distribution that's widely used in inferential statistics (eg hypothesis tests, confidence interval estimation).
