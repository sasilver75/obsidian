What is a modality?
- Refers to the way in which something is *expressed* or *perceived*
- Some modalities are more "raw" (closer to the sensor), and some are more abstract and processed (further from the sensor)

The closer you are to the raw modalities, the more relevant to this class you are. The more abstracted, the more similar your modalities will look (maybe in their representations, eg being simple 0s and 1s). In the raw modalities, you really need to think about the differences related to the sources of data.

The simple definition for Multimodal is "==having multiple modalities==," but we prefer: ==the scientific study of heterogenous (they're different) and interconnected (so that bringing them together brings an advantage) data.==
