Means that a process involves answering questions by reasoning across multiple pieces of information, or "hops." Requires integrating information from several sources or parts of text to derive the correct answer.

I don't believe this implies that these multiple queries need to be done "in series," in the sense that Document A leads to a question asked of Document B, which leads to a question asked of Document C. I think it's totally still multi-hop in the case where you (could) ask these three questions in parallel.
