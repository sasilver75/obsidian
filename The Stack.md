An Eleuther Dataset of ~6TB (320x larger than Wikpiedia), 200B tokens, that has permissive software image licenses. Cleaned of license files, image blobs, etc. Anyone can train on this.
This is a code dataset, compared to the Pile, which is a text dataset.

In late Feb 2024, [[The Stack v2]] was released, which is about 5x larger at ~900B tokens (~67.5TB).
