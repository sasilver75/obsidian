June (?), 2023 -- Open-Orca research group
HuggingFace Dataset card: [OpenOrca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca)

(Note: The Open-Orca organization generally tries to reconstruct the techniques/models/datasets used in the [[Orca]] paper. This page is about the dataset produced in that effort.)

This rich collection of augmented [[FLAN v2]] data aligns, as best as possible, with the distributions outlined in theÂ [Orca paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707). It has been instrumental in generating high-performing model checkpoints and serves as a valuable resource for all NLP researchers and developers!

==Approximately 1M GPT-4 completions and 3.2 Million GPT-3.5 completions==
