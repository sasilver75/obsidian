A full-stack library from [[HuggingFace]] with a set of tools to train transformer language models with RL, from the [[Supervised Fine-Tuning|SFT]] step, Reward Modeling (RM) step, to the [[Proximal Policy Optimization|PPO]] step.
(Can also be used to train models with [[Identity-Mapping Preference Optimization|IPO]], [[Kahneman-Tversky Optimization|KTO]], and more!)

This library is integrated with `transformers`
