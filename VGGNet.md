Abstract
> In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a ==thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth== using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by ==pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers==. These findings were the basis of our ==ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first== and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.
