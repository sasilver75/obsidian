Vectors refer to quantities that can't be expressed by a single number. In Physics, they refer to quantities that have magnitude and direction (eg forces, velocities), while in Computer Science they're often thought of as ordered lists of numbers (eg tuples). Both geometric vectors can be added and scaled, leading to the concept of vector spaces.

They give data analysts a way to conceptualize lists of numbers in a visual way, and gives people like physicists a language to describe space, and the manipulation of space, using numbers that can be crunched and run through a computer.

Above: The coordinates of a vector are (eg) a pair of numbers that basically give instructions for how to get from the tail of the vector at the origin to its tip, with the first number telling you how far to walk along the x-axis, and the second number how far to walk parallel to the y-axis. You can continue to add dimensions/axes as needed, increasing the length of your vector representation.

We can add same-dimensioned vectors, multiply by scalars, and apply linear  transformations to vectors.
