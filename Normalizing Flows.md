**==Normalizing Flows==** are a method for constructing complex distributions by transforming a probability density through a series of invertible mappings. By repeatedly applying the rule for change of variables, the initial density ‘flows’ through the sequence of invertible mappings. At the end of this sequence we obtain a valid probability distribution and hence this type of flow is referred to as a normalizing flow.
