Paper: [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)

Abstract:
> We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, ==BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers==. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model ==can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks==, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.
