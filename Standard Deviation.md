The standard deviation $\sigma$ (or SD) is a measure of the amount of expected variation of a random variable about its mean -- low standard deviations indicate that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while high standard deviations indicate that values are spread over a wider range.

It's defined as the ==square root of the [[Variance]]==

$\sigma(X) = \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[(X - \mu)^2]}$ 

alternatively:

$\sigma(X) = \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[X^2] - E[X]^2}$
