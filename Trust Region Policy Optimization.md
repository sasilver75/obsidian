From something unrelated re: KTO on Vertex Ventures pod: "Trust Region": The idea is that if I'm climbing up a mountain I want to make sure that I'm taking a big enough step that I don't move to slowly, but a large enough step that I don't fall off a cliff. You want to make sure the region you're moving in is the right size...
