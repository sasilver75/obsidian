A type of ML where an algorithm is trained on labeled data. In this approach, the training dataset includes input-output pairs, where each input is associated with the correct output. The algorithm learns to map inputs to output labels with the goal of making accurate predictions when presented with new, unseen data.

Supervised learning is applicable in either Regression or Classification scenarios, but isn't usually appropriate for (eg) Clustering, which is generally powered by [[Unsupervised Learning]].

Models include linear/logistic regression, Decision Trees, SVMs, and Neural Networks.
