Paper: [LAION-5B: An open large-scale dataset for training next-generation image-text models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08402)

A dataset of 5.85 billion [[CLIP]]-filtered image-text pairs, of which 2.32B contain english English language.
((CLIP-filtered meaning if CLIP outputs a low score for an image and its label, it's not considered good enough to go into the dataset. So we can be reasonably confident as to image labels "fitting" images. See an explanation for this in the [[LAION-400M]] page)).

Seems to basically be a bigger version of [[LAION-400M]].{}

Abstract
> Groundbreaking language-vision architectures like ==[[CLIP]] and [[DALL-E]] proved the utility of training on large amounts of noisy image-text data, without relying on expensive accurate labels== used in standard vision unimodal supervised learning. The resulting models showed capabilities of strong text-guided image generation and transfer to downstream tasks, while performing remarkably at zero-shot classification with noteworthy out-of-distribution robustness. Since then, large-scale language-vision models like [[ALIGN]], BASIC, [[GLIDE]], [[Flamingo]] and [[Imagen]] made further improvements. ==Studying the training and capabilities of such models requires datasets containing billions of image-text pairs==. Until now, no datasets of this size have been made openly available for the broader research community. To address this problem and democratize research on large-scale multi-modal models, we present ==LAION-5B== - a ==dataset consisting of 5.85 billion CLIP-filtered image-text pairs, of which 2.32B contain English language==. We show successful replication and fine-tuning of foundational models like CLIP, GLIDE and Stable Diffusion using the dataset, and discuss further experiments enabled with an openly available dataset of this scale. Additionally we provide several nearest neighbor indices, an ==improved web-interface for dataset exploration and subset generation, and detection scores for watermark, NSFW, and toxic content detection==.
