A type of [[Image Segmentation]]

This technique combines both [[Semantic Segmentation]] and [[Instance Segmentation]]. In panoptic segmentation, ==each pixel is assigned a semantic label as well as an instance ID==. To differentiate panoptic segmentation a bit better from instance segmentation, the latter focuses on identifying each instance of each recognized object in the scene. I.e., instance segmentation is concerned primarily with "things" - identifiable objects like cars, people, or animals. On the other hand, ==panoptic segmentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the scene by labeling every pixel with either a class label (for "stuff", uncountable regions like sky, grass, etc.) or an instance label (for "things", countable objects like cars, people, etc.).==
