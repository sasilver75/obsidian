The SE of a statistic (usually an estimate of a parameter) is the [[Standard Deviation]] of its sampling distribution (or an estimate of that deviation). It ==quantifies the precision of an estimate==, typically of some parameter like the mean, and indicates how much a sample statistic is likely to vary from the true population parameter. Think of it as a "margin of error" around your estimate (with respect to the true population value)

The sampling distribution of a mean is generated by repeated sampling from the same population and recording of the sample means obtained. This forms a distribution of different means, and this distribution has its own mean and variance. Mathematically, the variance of the sampling mean distribution obtained is equal to the variance of the population divided by the sample size. This is because as the sample size increases, sample means cluster more closely around the population mean.
