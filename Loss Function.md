Loss functions measure the degree of dissimilarity of predicted results to target values, and represent the thing that we want to minimize during training. 

Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE/L2) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE/L1) for regression tasks, or Negative Log Likelihood and Cross Entropy losses for classification.
