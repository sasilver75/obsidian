In probability theory, **conditional probability** is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) is already known to have occurred.

Events can either be dependent or independent.

Events are independent if their conditional probabilities are no different from their marginal probabilities.
