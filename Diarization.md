A process in audio signal process and speech recognition that involves partitioning an audio stream into homogenous segments, according to speaker identity. It answers the "who spoke when" question in an audio recording with multiple speakers, and basically creates a "script" in which only one person is speaking at at a time.

Key Components:
- Speech Activity Detection (SAD): Identifying speech vs. non-speech regions
- Speaker Segmentation: Divide audio into speaker-homogenous segments
- Speaker Clustering: Grouping segments belonging to the same speaker
- Speaker Identification: Assigning known speaker identities to clusters
