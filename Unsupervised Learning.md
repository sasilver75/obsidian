A type of machine learning where an algorithm is used to analyze and learn patterns from data without the help of labels.
The algorithm tries to identify inherent structures, patterns, and relationships within the input data; the goal is to discover patterns/groupings without explicit instructions on what to look for.

Examples include [[K-Means Clustering]], hierarchical clustering, [[Principal Component Analysis]], [[t-SNE]], and [[Autoencoder]]s!

In contrast, Classification and Regression-related models like logistic regression, SVMs, and neural networks belong to the [[Supervised Learning]] pardigm.
