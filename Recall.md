[[Precision]] can be seen as a measure of *quality*, and Recall as a measure of *quantity*.

Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones, and high recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned).

![{\displaystyle {\text{Recall}}={\frac {\text{Relevant retrieved instances}}{\text{All relevant instances}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c3c5350d4d74f4e18962798289b91795e76140b4)

If our model has a recall of .11, it correctly identifies (has a positive response for) 11% of all of the records that *actually* represented tumors.
