The **central limit theorem** states that if you take sufficiently large samples from a population, the samples’ means will be normally distributed, even if the population isn’t normally distributed!

Explanation (in other words):
- Suppose that a large sample of observations are obtained, with each observation being randomly produced in a way that doesn't depend on the values of the other observations, and that the average (arithmetic mean) of the observed values is computed.
- If this procedure is many times, resulting in a *collection* of observed averages, the CLT states that if the sample size was large enough, the probability distribution of these *averages* will closely approximate a normal distribution.
