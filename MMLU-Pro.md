Note: In May 2024, researchers improved [[Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding|MMLU]] with [[MMLU-Pro]], which increases the MC number of questions from 4-10, and incorporates 12187 hard questions from Scibench, TheoremQA, STEM sites, while also subslicing the original MMLU to remove trivial and ambiguous questions. It is a *refined* and *expanded* version of MMLU.

Claude 3 Sonnet saw its performance fall from .815 on MMLU to .6793 on MMLU Pro
