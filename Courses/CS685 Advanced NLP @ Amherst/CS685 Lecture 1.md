Not a lot going on in this lecture, I just scrubbed over it. We're going to be covering the usual topics that you might expect from (eg) 224U.

The teacher feels like a PhD student, which is good in some ways (newer techniques, closer to my level of understanding) and bad in other ways (doesn't have the long perspective of Manning or Potts)
