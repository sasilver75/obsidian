Office hours 30 minutes before class, or send her an email on Slack


Goals:
- Gain experience with ML approaches for NLP; Intro for general ML, how deep learning, using PyTorch to implement models, and why specific deep learning techniques work for specific problems.


Questions:
- She wants to have homework 3 be a n assignment where you build a language model.
	- Ask her if she's familiar with Andrej Karpathy's NanGPT, etc.
	- This is also a great point to jump off, if there's extra credit or something. Lots of little things that you can add on.

For the final project, the idea being to get something into shape where you can extend it to be a paper if you want to.

Talking about a team project from SemEval 2025


Leaderboard for each homework (ie CodaLab); each student should create a CodaLab account to participate in; CodaLab ranks results according to evaluation metrics (eg Accuracy and F1 score);
- Students turn in a report (PDF) and a zip file with their code onCanvas assignments.
- ==25% of grading will be based on performance on leaderboard, lol.==
