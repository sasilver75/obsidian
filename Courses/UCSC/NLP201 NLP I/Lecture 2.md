There's ambiguity at lexical levels:
Two definitions of mother:
- a woman who has given birth to a child
- A stringy slimy substance consisting of yeast cells and bacteria; is added to cider or wine to produce vinegar.

This is an instance of word sense ambiguity.


At the semantic (meaning) level:
- They put money in the bank (buried in the mud?)
- I saw her duck with a telescope (I saw her duck through my telescope, she was carrying a telescope as she ducked, her duck had a telescope, etc.)
	- The "with a telescope" is a prepositional phrase. "Prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity" can be difficult to resolve (does it relate to duck, or to I?)

There'sa lso ambiguity at the discourse (multi-clause level)
- Alice says they they've built a computer that understands you like your mother.
- BUT ==she==:
	- ...Doesn't know any details (she referes to alice)
	- ...Doesn't understand me at all (she refers to your mother)

This is an instance of [[Anaphora]], where she co-references to some other discourse entity
