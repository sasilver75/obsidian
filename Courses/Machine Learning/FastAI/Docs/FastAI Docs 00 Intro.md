The best way to get started with `fastai` and deep learning is to read the book and complete the free course.

`fastai` is a deep learning library that:
* Provides practitioners with ==high-level components== that can quickly and easily provide state of the art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with ==low-level components== that can be mixed and matched to build *new* approaches!
* This is possible thanks to a *carefully-layered architecture,* which expresses common underlying patterns on many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions.
* `fastai` includes:
	* A new ==type dispatch system== for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors.
	* A GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python.
	* An optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4-5 lines of code.
	* A novel ==2-way callback system== that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training.
	* A new ==data block== API
	* And much much more!

- Above: 
	- The high-level APIs enable developers to be productive and easily approach the library, whereas the lower-level APIs enable it to be deeply hackable and configurable by providing a collection of **composable** building blocks! ðŸ§±
