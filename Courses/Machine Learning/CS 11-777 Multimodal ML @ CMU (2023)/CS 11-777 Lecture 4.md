==Connection==: Knowledge from one modality that provides information about the other modality. In statistics, this is also known as *==association==* (eg between features) or ==dependency==. It means that when we say "Kitchen," there's some object that you expect in the image, or if you see an image, there are certain words you expect.

We did an example of CLIP
- Where the InfoNCE models something very close to mutual information

Mutual Information... at the basics from information theory, if you had to associate one emotion with information theory, it's *surprise* -- if something is surprising in data (eg a flat distribution), that's low information; something peaky has high entropy/information -- that's why information is 1/p(x).

We mathematically designed this Mutual INformation equation...
- "The probability of th two event happening jointly... divided by the probabilities of the events happening themselves"
- The mutual information formula is the ratio between them, or it could be the (KL) distance.
	- The numerator... is like... "joint event"..."co-occurrence". 

Modality Interactions
- There's no interaction without a response -- it *needs*a response. Interactions happen during inference (from a human or a model).
	- A human: "I'm seeing those modalities, and I'm inferring"...

Mutual Information really just means co-occurrence -- just joint probability (normalized by products of marginal probabilities).

Three-way mutual information is kind of undefined... there's a lot of argument about how to compute this.
- Sometimes when you mathematically look at it, it becomes negative ðŸ¤” Probabilities are always positive, usually!





Anyways, today we'll talk more about Modality Alignment
