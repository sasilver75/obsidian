There are so few videos (and short ones) in this course that I'm going to crush the information into a single note.

Instructor: Prof. Hazel Sive (in 2024, she's a Dean of Science @ Northeastern)

Everything is made up of tiny building blocks called cells. The Nuceli of cells are where the genetic material lives. Everything comes from a single cell; a beautiful bird or a spider or a sea creature all come from a single cell.
- Some animals can regenerate their body parts if they're cut in half. 
- In ocean life, Prochlorococcus is the world's most abundant bacterium -- we don't know their function, but likely have a lot to do with the health of our waters; recent research show it makes and secretes proteins into the water, but their functions are unknown.
- How what we eat influences the type of cancers we get, and what cures might look like.
- Thinking about life as part of the engineering spectrum; how do we make new things? Can we use DNA constructed into specific scaffolds/shapes to do interesting engineering things, like harvest energy from light?

There's a lot of excitement!
- This course (five lectures) is useful for you since you haven't had highschool biology since you were a freshman, or if you need a refresher class before taking introductory biology in college.

# Representing Molecules
Topics:
1. Bonds build molecules
2. Macromolecules themselves

The building blocks of life are cells; life is made of cells.
==In humans, cells have about a ~10uM diameter==
- They are made of large (macro)molecules, and are a bag of chemical reactions.


 Bonds holds molecules together.
- Bonding is due to *attraction between atoms*.
- ==In life, there are certain key elements that come up over and over again:==
	1. Carbon
	2. Oxygen
	3. Nitrogen
	4. Phosphorous
	5. Sulfur
- We need to understand ==valency==, which refers to how many bonds an atom can make.
	- This is a key concept in biology!
- We need to be able to somehow represent molecules in an easy-to-deal with way...

These are 5 different schematics of a molecule called 1-butanol.
- ==Chemical Formula==
	- 4 carbons, 9 hydrogens, and an oxygen and a hydrogen that is kind of written separately because the OH is a unit; a hydroxyl group.
- ==Full Structure==: All atoms and bonds are shown; it's difficult and nuisance to do this, so we use the Bond-Line Structure
- ==Bond-Line Structure==: Instead of the carbons, there's a broken/zig-zag line. The carbons are at the corners/ends of every line. 
	- We can show this with a blue dot for the carbons, and a red dot for the hydrogens.
	- Because of valency, we can figure out where the H atoms are because each C makes four bodies (valency of four; a reason why it's a pivotal atom in life).


# Polar and Non-Polar Molecules
Another key concept is ==electronegativity==, which refers to the attraction of an atom, for electrons.
- In biology, we need to distinguish two kinds of molecules that are different based on their electronegativity (en).
	1. ==Polar==: Have an unequal en; these molecules are always hydrophilic based on having one charged portion of the molecule.
	2. ==Non-Polar==: There's an equal en; these tend to by hydrophobic.

Whether a molecule is polar or not depends on two things:
1. Whether it has polar bonds, where the electrons are unequally distributed
2. Depends on the geometry of the molecule (but we won't look at this too much)

Above: Unequal electron distribution (a ==dipole==)
- The dipole is because the oxygen in the water is very electro-negative; it pulls electrons towards it, depleting the electrons somewhat from the hydrogens that it's bonded to -- so you have a molecule where the oxygen is somewhat negative, and the hydrogens are somewhat positive.
	- This is indicated by these $\delta$ symbols.
- The geometry of the molecule is also such that these dipoles don't cancel out, so you get a molecule that's polar overall.

One of these is polar, and the other is nonpolar.
- Nonpolar: Neither Carbons nor Hydrogens are particularly electronegative atoms -- neither have a tendency to pull electrons more than the other, and so the bonds/molecule are overall non-polar, with an equal distribution of electrons throughout the molecule.
- Polar: Isopropanol has a hydroxyl group added to it. The Oxygen is highly electronegative, so it pulls electrons away from the carbons and hydrogens, so you get a partial negative charge in the Oxygen part of the hydroxyl, and the molecule is polar.
