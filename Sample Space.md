The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible [[Outcome]]s/results of the experiment, usually denoted using set notation.

Sample space for a coin flip: $\{H,T\}$
For two coin flips: $\{(H,T),(H,H),(T,T),(T,H)\}$
For three coin flips: $\{(H,H,H),(H,H,T),(H,T,H),(H,T,T),(T,H,H),(T,H,T),(T,T,H),(T,T,T)\}$ 

Any subset (of any size) of the sample space can be considered as an [[Event]].
